# Changes
## Pistol
- Uses d9mil ammo
- Fires as fast as you can shoot (think BL2 Jakobs pistol)
- 3-round burst alt-fire
- Quick draw speed
- Good twohand/dualwield accuracy and recoil
- 16 round magazine
- Lowered damage
  
The Pistol is a common weapon found in the world, dropped randomly by zombies and imps. Its damage is slightly lower, but now fires as fast as you can shoot! Along with a 3-round burst alt-fire and decent magazine size, it makes great companion piece due to its quick
draw speed, accuracy and plentiful availibility of its new ammo type (d9mil).
## Shotgun
- Higher damage
- No alt-fire; Goes to primary instead
- Can be reloaded while dual-wielding
- Tighter spread
- Large recoil, especially when dual-wielding
  
The Shotgun fires the same for the most part, but can now rival the power of the Super Shotgun when using two! Its drop rate is no long guaranteed with sergeants, but they now drop more shells for you to use. Its relatively quick draw speed also makes it useful for softening
larger enemies.
## Super Shotgun
- Uses uncommon BFS (guess what it stands for)
- Alt-fire for single shot. Easier on the arms
- Must lower the other weapon to reload, but can half reload if you fire it empty while dual-wielding
- Heavy recoil
- Slow draw speed

The Super Shotgun is as good as it ever was, and even comes with an alt-fire mode to perform more accurate single shots. It does however use appropriately sized shells now, which can be hard to come by. That being said it still pairs well with rapid fire companions, as
although its reload is slow, you can empty the chambers without commiting fully to reloading it.
## Chaingun
- Fire rate increases while firing, similar to DOOM 2016 Chaingun
- Alt-fire revs gun up without using ammo
- Slow draw speed
- Managable recoil

The Chaingun may startup kinda slow, but once you get it going its fire rate is more than **double** the original's. Chaingunners are more hesitant to part ways with it now, but drop a lot more ammo to compensate. Get two of these babies going, and your enemies and clip supply
wont be having a good time.

## Rocket Launcher
- New alt-fire to fire rockets as bouncy grenades
- 6 round magazine
- Must lower the other weapon to reload
- Low recoil
- Slow draw speed

The Rocket Launcher can fire rockets normally, or as faster, bouncier grenades to serenade groups out of sight. Just beware that it's companion piece's recoil don't interfere with its trajectory. It also has a 6-round magazine that needs to be reloaded, so keep an eye on it.

## Plasma Rifle
- New alt-fire to charge shot. Charge time increases damage and blast radius
- No longer raise gun after firing
- Uses internal battery that must be charged
- Battery can be charged without lowering other weapon
- Very low recoil

The Plasma Rifle's low recoil and high damage output makes it a perfect rapid fire companion piece for tearing up the toughest foes you'll come across. Its new alt-fire also makes it great for decimating large groups of fodder with explosive charged shots. Keep in mind it's
power supply needs constant charging, and you'll know you need to recharge once it starts shooting slow.

## BFG 9000
- No new mechanics (yet!)
- **Cannot be fired while dual-wielding**
- Slow draw speed
- Heavy recoil

The **BFG 9000** is still as powerful as it needs to be, dishing out heavy recoil and heavier damage. For obvious reasons (weight) it is impossible to fire this weapon while trying to dual-wield weapons, **so only equip to your right handed weapons as using it in the left is
impossible!**

## Chainsaw
- No new mechanics (!yet)
- **Cannot be fired while dual-wielding**
- Fast draw speed
- Melee weapon

While very vanilla, the Chainsaw remains a reliable fallback option for hordes of zombies or tempting hell nobles. For obvious reasons (incomplete arm technology) it is impossible to use this weapon while trying to dual-wield weapons, **so only equip to you right handed weapons
as using it in the left is impossible!**

## Fist weapons

When you have no weapon equipped to a slot, you pull your fists out. Along with your classic brass knuckles, you can find two new fist weapons to pull out instead, and all come with special combos when dual-wielding!

### Brass Knuckles
- Left hand performs quick jabs
- Right hand performs slow hooks
- LP -> RP for a quick jab-hook combo
- Full 10x berserk bonus damage

The Brass Knuckles comes with new techniques to tenderize demon flesh. With your left hand, you throw out a jab to stun lock opponents. With your right hand, you throw out a jab to smash faces. Follow up a jab with a hook to throw it faster. Your Brass Knuckles get full berserk power when active.

### Power Fists
- Same attacks for left and right handed attacks
- LP + RP to swing both fists
- No berserk bonus

The experimental Power Fists crush enemies with explosive power, but are very cumbersome to swing. Press both fire buttons to swing both fists. Although they receive no berserk bonus, good footwork can lets you make short work of even large demons.

### Knives
- Left hand performs slow stab
- Right hand performs quick slices
- RP -> RP -> LP quick slice-stab combo
- 3x berserk bonus damage

While weaker than your Brass Knuckles, the Knives perform well at cutting up zombies and imps. Left fire for a stab attack. Right fire for up to two quick slashes. Follow up a stab with two slashes for a quicker stab.

### Berserk
- Reduces recoil for weapons
- Increases damage for Brass Knuckles and Knives
- 60 second time limit

The Berserk power effects now only last for 60 seconds. Plenty of time to rampage with either gun or fist, your choice.

# Items

### Tactical Backpack

The Tactical Backpack sometimes replaces the Backpack. Instead of increasing max ammo capacity, it increases weapon inventory size by 3 and quick slots by 1. Also has a chance to contain spare ammo.

### ESOA

The ESOA is a rare upgrade that can replace the BFG 9000. Once equip, you fire both weapons as if you are two-handing them, which includes not having to lower your weapons to reload! It must be charged to work, however, and slower, more powerful weapons use it up the fastest. The ESOA can be charged by picking up Cell ammo for the Plasma Rifle.
